**Language Policy**: Code, identifiers, file paths, and file contents stay in English. All user-facing replies, explanations, and commit/PR descriptions are in Chinese (中文). See [`.claude/docs/language-policy.md`](.claude/docs/language-policy.md).

## Phase 0: Parse Arguments

Extract the mode argument (`new`, `update`, or `status`) and resolve the review mode (once, store for all gate spawns this run):
1. If `--review [full|lean|solo]` was passed → use that
2. Else read `production/review-mode.txt` → use that value
3. Else → default to `lean`

See `.claude/docs/director-gates.md` for the full check pattern.

**Review mode check** (before gates run):
- Read `production/review-mode.txt` if it exists. Use that mode.
- If the file doesn't exist and this is a `new` sprint: use `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Prompt: "尚未设置审核模式。本轮 sprint 想使用多深的审核？"
  - Header: "审核深度"
  - Options:
    - `[A] full — 启动所有 director 和 lead 闸口`
    - `[B] lean — 跳过非阶段闸口的 director 审核（推荐用于大多数 sprint）`
    - `[C] solo — 完全跳过闸口启动`
  - After selection: write `production/review-mode.txt` with the chosen mode. Say: "Review mode set to [mode] and saved to production/review-mode.txt."
- If the file doesn't exist and this is NOT a `new` sprint (e.g., updating an existing sprint): default to `lean` silently.

## Phase 1: Gather Context

1. **Read the current milestone** from `production/milestones/`.

2. **Read the previous sprint** (if any) from `production/sprints/` to
   understand velocity and carryover.

3. **Scan design documents** in `design/gdd/` for features tagged as ready
   for implementation.

4. **Check the risk register** at `production/risk-register/`.

---

## Phase 2: Generate Output

For `new`:

**Generate a sprint plan** following this format and present it to the user. Do NOT ask to write yet — the producer feasibility gate (Phase 4) runs first and may require revisions before the file is written.

```markdown
# Sprint [N] — [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Sprint Goal
[One sentence describing what this sprint achieves toward the milestone]

## Capacity
- Total days: [X]
- Buffer (20%): [Y days reserved for unplanned work]
- Available: [Z days]

## Tasks

### Must Have (Critical Path)
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

### Should Have
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

### Nice to Have
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

## Carryover from Previous Sprint
| Task | Reason | New Estimate |
|------|--------|-------------|

## Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|

## Dependencies on External Factors
- [List any external dependencies]

## Definition of Done for this Sprint
- [ ] All Must Have tasks completed
- [ ] All tasks pass acceptance criteria
- [ ] QA plan exists (`production/qa/qa-plan-sprint-[N].md`)
- [ ] All Logic/Integration stories have passing unit/integration tests
- [ ] Smoke check passed (`/smoke-check sprint`)
- [ ] QA sign-off report: APPROVED or APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS (`/team-qa sprint`)
- [ ] No S1 or S2 bugs in delivered features
- [ ] Design documents updated for any deviations
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
```

For `update`:

**Update an existing sprint plan**:

1. Read the most recent sprint plan from `production/sprints/`.
2. Present the current story list with their current statuses from `production/sprint-status.yaml`.
3. Ask the user what to change: stories to add, remove, reprioritize, or re-estimate. Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather changes.
4. Apply the changes and re-present the full revised plan for review.
5. Re-run the producer feasibility gate (Phase 4) on the revised plan.
6. Write the updated markdown plan and yaml together (same approval as `new` mode).

Note: `update` mode does not reset story statuses. Stories already marked `in-progress` or `done` keep their status. Only `backlog` and `ready-for-dev` stories can be removed or reprioritized freely.

For `status`:

**Generate a status report**:

```markdown
# Sprint [N] Status -- [Date]

## Progress: [X/Y tasks complete] ([Z%])

### Completed
| Task | Completed By | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|

### In Progress
| Task | Owner | % Done | Blockers |
|------|-------|--------|----------|

### Not Started
| Task | Owner | At Risk? | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|

### Blocked
| Task | Blocker | Owner of Blocker | ETA |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----|

## Burndown Assessment
[On track / Behind / Ahead]
[If behind: What is being cut or deferred]

## Emerging Risks
- [Any new risks identified this sprint]
```

## Phase 3: Prepare Sprint Status File

After generating a new sprint plan, also prepare the `production/sprint-status.yaml` content.
This is the machine-readable source of truth for story status — read by
`/sprint-status`, `/story-done`, and `/help` without markdown parsing.

**Do not write the yaml yet** — hold it in context. The producer feasibility gate (Phase 4) may revise the story list. Both files will be written together after Phase 4 in a single write approval.

Format:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by /sprint-plan. Updated by /story-done and /dev-story.
# DO NOT edit manually — use /story-done to update story status.
#
# Status value mapping (yaml ↔ story file Status field):
#   backlog        ↔  Not Started
#   ready-for-dev  ↔  Ready
#   in-progress    ↔  In Progress
#   review         ↔  In Review
#   done           ↔  Complete
#   blocked        ↔  Blocked

sprint: [N]
goal: "[sprint goal]"
start: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
end: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
generated: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
updated: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"

stories:
  - id: "[epic-story, e.g. 1-1]"
    name: "[story name]"
    file: "[production/stories/path.md]"
    priority: must-have        # must-have | should-have | nice-to-have
    status: ready-for-dev      # backlog | ready-for-dev | in-progress | review | done | blocked
    owner: ""
    estimate_days: 0
    blocker: ""
    completed: ""
```

Initialize each story from the sprint plan's task tables:
- Must Have tasks → `priority: must-have`, `status: ready-for-dev`
- Should Have tasks → `priority: should-have`, `status: backlog`
- Nice to Have tasks → `priority: nice-to-have`, `status: backlog`

For `update`: read the existing `sprint-status.yaml`, carry over statuses for
stories that haven't changed, add new stories, remove dropped ones.

---

## Phase 4: Producer Feasibility Gate

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning PR-SPRINT:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "PR-SPRINT skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 5 (QA plan gate).
- `lean` → skip (not a PHASE-GATE). Note: "PR-SPRINT skipped — Lean mode." Proceed to Phase 5 (QA plan gate).
- `full` → spawn as normal.

Before finalising the sprint plan, spawn `producer` via Task using gate **PR-SPRINT** (`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`).

Pass: proposed story list (titles, estimates, dependencies), total team capacity in hours/days, any carryover from the previous sprint, milestone constraints and deadline.

Present the producer's assessment.

If UNREALISTIC: revise the story selection (defer stories to Should Have or Nice to Have) and re-present the updated plan before asking for write approval.

If CONCERNS, use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Prompt: "Producer 对此 sprint 计划提出了担忧。你想如何处理？"
- Header: "处理方式"
- Options:
  - `[A] 按计划推进——我接受这个风险`
  - `[B] 调整范围——把部分 Should Have 故事推迟`
  - `[C] 延长 sprint 时间线`

If [A]: proceed to write approval.
If [B]: revise the story list, re-present the updated plan, then proceed to write approval.
If [C]: adjust sprint dates and capacity, re-present the updated plan, then proceed to write approval.

After handling the producer's verdict, ask: "May I write the sprint plan to `production/sprints/sprint-[N].md` and `production/sprint-status.yaml`?" If yes, write both files (creating directories as needed). Verdict: **COMPLETE** — sprint plan and status file created. If no: Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.

After writing, add:

> **Scope check:** If this sprint includes stories added beyond the original epic scope, run `/scope-check [epic]` to detect scope creep before implementation begins.

---

## Phase 5: QA Plan Gate

Before closing the sprint plan, check whether a QA plan exists for this sprint.

Use `Glob` to look for `production/qa/qa-plan-sprint-[N].md` or any file in `production/qa/` referencing this sprint number.

**If a QA plan is found**: note it in the sprint plan output — "QA Plan: `[path]`" — and proceed.

**If no QA plan exists**: do not silently proceed. Surface this explicitly:

> "This sprint has no QA plan. A sprint plan without a QA plan means test requirements are undefined — developers won't know what 'done' looks like from a QA perspective, and the sprint cannot pass the Production → Polish gate without one.
>
> Run `/qa-plan sprint` now, before starting any implementation. It takes one session and produces the test case requirements each story needs."

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Prompt: "本 sprint 未找到 QA 计划。你想如何处理？"
- Header: "QA 计划"
- Options:
  - `[A] 立即运行 /qa-plan sprint——在开始实现之前完成（推荐）`
  - `[B] 暂时跳过——我理解 QA 签字会在 Production → Polish 闸口被阻断`

If [A]: close with "Sprint plan written. Run `/qa-plan sprint` next — then begin implementation."
If [B]: add a warning block to the sprint plan document:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **No QA Plan**: This sprint was started without a QA plan. Run `/qa-plan sprint`
> before the last story is implemented. The Production → Polish gate requires a QA
> sign-off report, which requires a QA plan.
```

---

## Phase 6: Next Steps

After the sprint plan is written and QA plan status is resolved:

- `/qa-plan sprint` — **required before implementation begins** — defines test cases per story so developers implement against QA specs, not a blank slate
- `/story-readiness [story-file]` — validate a story is ready before starting it
- `/dev-story [story-file]` — begin implementing the first story
- `/sprint-status` — check progress mid-sprint
- `/scope-check [epic]` — verify no scope creep before implementation begins

**Review mode configuration:** All director gates (producer feasibility, QA review, code review) respect the project review mode. The review mode is set in Phase 0 when the file does not exist (for `new` sprints), or can be overridden per-run with `--review full|lean|solo` as an argument. The file `production/review-mode.txt` contains one of:
- `lean` — skip automated director gates (default if file is absent — fastest for solo dev)
- `full` — run all director gates as spawned sub-agents
- `solo` — skip all gates unconditionally (single-developer, no review)

This file is read by `/sprint-plan`, `/story-readiness`, `/story-done`, and other skills at startup.
