## Quick Start

### What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Claude Code** installed and working
- **Git** with Git Bash (Windows) or standard terminal (Mac/Linux)
- **jq** (optional but recommended -- hooks fall back to `grep` if missing)
- **Python 3** (optional -- some hooks use it for JSON validation)

### Step 1: Clone and Open

```bash
git clone <repo-url> my-game
cd my-game
```

### Step 2: Run /start

If this is your first session:

```
/start
```

This guided onboarding asks where you are and routes you to the right phase:

- **Path A** -- No idea yet: routes to `/brainstorm`
- **Path B** -- Vague idea: routes to `/brainstorm` with seed
- **Path C** -- Clear concept: routes to `/setup-engine` and `/map-systems`
- **Path D1** -- Existing project, few artifacts: normal flow
- **Path D2** -- Existing project, GDDs/ADRs exist: runs `/project-stage-detect`
  then `/adopt` for brownfield migration

### Step 3: Verify Hooks Are Working

Start a new Claude Code session. You should see output from the
`session-start.sh` hook:

```
=== Claude Code Game Studios -- Session Context ===
Branch: main
Recent commits:
  abc1234 Initial commit
===================================
```

If you see this, hooks are working. If not, check `.claude/settings.json` to
make sure the hook paths are correct for your OS.

### Step 4: Ask for Help Anytime

At any point, run:

```
/help
```

This reads your current phase from `production/stage.txt`, checks which
artifacts exist, and tells you exactly what to do next. It distinguishes
between REQUIRED next steps and OPTIONAL opportunities.

### Step 5: Create Your Directory Structure

Directories are created as needed. The system expects this layout:

```
src/                  # Game source code
  core/               # Engine/framework code
  gameplay/           # Gameplay systems
  ai/                 # AI systems
  networking/         # Multiplayer code
  ui/                 # UI code
  tools/              # Dev tools
assets/               # Game assets
  art/                # Sprites, models, textures
  audio/              # Music, SFX
  vfx/                # Particle effects
  shaders/            # Shader files
  data/               # JSON config/balance data
design/               # Design documents
  gdd/                # Game design documents
  narrative/          # Story, lore, dialogue
  levels/             # Level design documents
  balance/            # Balance spreadsheets and data
  ux/                 # UX specifications
docs/                 # Technical documentation
  architecture/       # Architecture Decision Records
  api/                # API documentation
  postmortems/        # Post-mortems
tests/                # Test suites
prototypes/           # Throwaway prototypes
production/           # Sprint plans, milestones, releases
  sprints/
  milestones/
  releases/
  epics/              # Epic and story files (from /create-epics + /create-stories)
  playtests/          # Playtest reports
  session-state/      # Ephemeral session state (gitignored)
  session-logs/       # Session audit trail (gitignored)
```

> **Tip:** You do not need all of these on day one. Create directories as you
> reach the phase that needs them. The important thing is to follow this
> structure when you do create them, because the **rules system** enforces
> standards based on file paths. Code in `src/gameplay/` gets gameplay rules,
> code in `src/ai/` gets AI rules, and so on.

## Phase 1: Concept

### What Happens in This Phase

You go from "no idea" or "vague idea" to a structured game concept document
with defined pillars and a player journey. This is where you figure out
**what** you are making and **why**.

### Phase 1 Pipeline

```
/brainstorm  -->  game-concept.md  -->  /design-review  -->  /setup-engine
     |                                        |                    |
     v                                        v                    v
  10 concepts     Concept doc with       Validation          Engine pinned in
  MDA analysis    pillars, MDA,          of concept          technical-preferences.md
  Player motiv.   core loop, USP         document
                                                                   |
                                                                   v
                                                             /prototype
                                                       (concept prototype — 1-3 days)
                                                        PROCEED ↓     PIVOT → /brainstorm
                                                                   |
                                                                   v (PROCEED)
                                                             /map-systems
                                                                   |
                                                                   v
                                                            systems-index.md
                                                            (all systems, deps,
                                                             priority tiers)
```

### Step 1.1: Brainstorm With /brainstorm

This is your starting point. Run the brainstorm skill:

```
/brainstorm
```

Or with a genre hint:

```
/brainstorm roguelike deckbuilder
```

**What happens:** The brainstorm skill guides you through a collaborative 6-phase
ideation process using professional studio techniques:

1. Asks about your interests, themes, and constraints
2. Generates 10 concept seeds with MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) analysis
3. You pick 2-3 favorites for deep analysis
4. Performs player motivation mapping and audience targeting
5. You choose the winning concept
6. Formalizes it into `design/gdd/game-concept.md`

The concept document includes:

- Elevator pitch (one sentence)
- Core fantasy (what the player imagines themselves doing)
- MDA breakdown
- Target audience (Bartle types, demographics)
- Core loop diagram
- Unique selling proposition
- Comparable titles and differentiation
- Game pillars (3-5 non-negotiable design values)
- Anti-pillars (things the game intentionally avoids)

### Step 1.2: Review the Concept (Optional but Recommended)

```
/design-review design/gdd/game-concept.md
```

Validates structure and completeness before you proceed.

### Step 1.3: Choose Your Engine

```
/setup-engine
```

Or with a specific engine:

```
/setup-engine godot 4.6
```

**What /setup-engine does:**

- Populates `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` with naming conventions,
  performance budgets, and engine-specific defaults
- Detects knowledge gaps (engine version newer than LLM training data) and
  advises cross-referencing `docs/engine-reference/`
- Creates version-pinned reference docs in `docs/engine-reference/`

**Why this matters:** Once you set the engine, the system knows which
engine-specialist agents to use. If you pick Godot, agents like
`godot-specialist`, `godot-gdscript-specialist`, and `godot-shader-specialist`
become your go-to experts.

### Step 1.4: Decompose Your Concept Into Systems

Before writing individual GDDs, enumerate all the systems your game needs:

```
/map-systems
```

This creates `design/gdd/systems-index.md` -- a master tracking document that:

- Lists every system your game needs (combat, movement, UI, etc.)
- Maps dependencies between systems
- Assigns priority tiers (MVP, Vertical Slice, Alpha, Full Vision)
- Determines design order (Foundation > Core > Feature > Presentation > Polish)

This step is **required** before proceeding to Phase 2. Research from 155 game
postmortems confirms that skipping systems enumeration costs 5-10x more in
production.

### Phase 1 Gate

```
/gate-check systems-design
```

> The argument is the phase you are **entering**, not the one you are leaving.
> `/gate-check systems-design` runs the Concept → Systems Design gate.

**Requirements to pass:**

- Engine configured in `technical-preferences.md`
- `design/gdd/game-concept.md` exists with pillars
- `design/gdd/systems-index.md` exists with dependency ordering

**Verdict:** PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL. CONCERNS is passable with acknowledged
risks. FAIL reports blockers and strongly advises against advancing — but the
verdict is advisory; you decide. See "Gate verdicts are advisory" below.

---

## Phase 2: Systems Design

### What Happens in This Phase

You create all the design documents that define how your game works. Nothing
gets coded yet -- this is pure design. Each system identified in the systems
index gets its own GDD, authored section by section, reviewed individually,
and then all GDDs are cross-checked for consistency.

### Phase 2 Pipeline

```
/map-systems next  -->  /design-system  -->  /design-review
       |                     |                     |
       v                     v                     v
  Picks next system    Section-by-section     Validates 8
  from systems-index   GDD authoring          required sections
                       (incremental writes)   APPROVED/NEEDS REVISION
       |
       |  (repeat for each MVP system)
       v
/review-all-gdds
       |
       v
  Cross-GDD consistency + design theory review
  PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL
```

### Step 2.1: Author System GDDs

Design each system in dependency order using the guided workflow:

```
/map-systems next
```

This picks the highest-priority undesigned system and hands off to
`/design-system`, which guides you through creating its GDD section by section.

You can also design a specific system directly:

```
/design-system combat-system
```

**What /design-system does:**

1. Reads your game concept, systems index, and any upstream/downstream GDDs
2. Runs a Technical Feasibility Pre-Check (domain mapping + feasibility brief)
3. Walks you through each of the 8 required GDD sections one at a time
4. Each section follows: Context > Questions > Options > Decision > Draft > Approval > Write
5. Each section is written to file immediately after approval (survives crashes)
6. Flags conflicts with existing approved GDDs
7. Routes to specialist agents per category (systems-designer for math,
   economy-designer for economy, narrative-director for story systems)

**The 8 required GDD sections:**

| # | Section | What Goes Here |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | **Overview** | One-paragraph summary of the system |
| 2 | **Player Fantasy** | What the player imagines/feels when using this system |
| 3 | **Detailed Rules** | Unambiguous mechanical rules |
| 4 | **Formulas** | Every calculation, with variable definitions and ranges |
| 5 | **Edge Cases** | What happens in weird situations? Explicitly resolved. |
| 6 | **Dependencies** | What other systems this connects to (bidirectional) |
| 7 | **Tuning Knobs** | Which values designers can safely change, with safe ranges |
| 8 | **Acceptance Criteria** | How do you test that this works? Specific, measurable. |

Plus a **Game Feel** section: feel reference, input responsiveness (ms/frames),
animation feel targets (startup/active/recovery), impact moments, weight profile.

### Step 2.2: Review Each GDD

Before the next system starts, validate the current one:

```
/design-review design/gdd/combat-system.md
```

Checks all 8 sections for completeness, formula clarity, edge case resolution,
bidirectional dependencies, and testable acceptance criteria.

**Verdict:** APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION / MAJOR REVISION. Only APPROVED GDDs
should proceed.

### Step 2.3: Small Changes Without Full GDDs

For tuning changes, small additions, or tweaks that do not warrant a full GDD:

```
/quick-design "add 10% damage bonus for flanking attacks"
```

This creates a lightweight spec in `design/quick-specs/` instead of a full
8-section GDD. Use it for tuning, number changes, and small additions.

### Step 2.4: Cross-GDD Consistency Review

After all MVP system GDDs are approved individually:

```
/review-all-gdds
```

This reads ALL GDDs simultaneously and runs two analysis phases:

**Phase 1 -- Cross-GDD Consistency:**
- Dependency bidirectionality (A references B, does B reference A?)
- Rule contradictions between systems
- Stale references to renamed or removed systems
- Ownership conflicts (two systems claiming the same responsibility)
- Formula range compatibility (does System A's output fit System B's input?)
- Acceptance criteria cross-check

**Phase 2 -- Design Theory (Game Design Holism):**
- Competing progression loops (do two systems fight for the same reward space?)
- Cognitive load (more than 4 active systems at once?)
- Dominant strategies (one approach that makes all others irrelevant)
- Economic loop analysis (sources and sinks balanced?)
- Difficulty curve consistency across systems
- Pillar alignment and anti-pillar violations
- Player fantasy coherence

**Output:** `design/gdd/gdd-cross-review-[date].md` with a verdict.

### Step 2.5: Narrative Design (If Applicable)

If your game has story, lore, or dialogue, this is when you build it:

1. **World-building** -- Use `world-builder` to define factions, history,
   geography, and rules of your world
2. **Story structure** -- Use `narrative-director` to design story arcs,
   character arcs, and narrative beats
3. **Character sheets** -- Use the `narrative-character-sheet.md` template

### Phase 2 Gate

```
/gate-check technical-setup
```

**Requirements to pass:**

- All MVP systems in `systems-index.md` have `Status: Approved`
- Each MVP system has a reviewed GDD
- Cross-GDD review report exists (`design/gdd/gdd-cross-review-*.md`)
  with verdict of PASS or CONCERNS (not FAIL)

---

## Phase 3: Technical Setup

### What Happens in This Phase

You make key technical decisions, document them as Architecture Decision Records
(ADRs), validate them through review, and produce a control manifest that
gives programmers flat, actionable rules. You also establish UX foundations.

### Phase 3 Pipeline

```
/create-architecture  -->  /architecture-decision (x N)  -->  /architecture-review
        |                          |                                   |
        v                          v                                   v
  Master architecture       Per-decision ADRs              Validates completeness,
  document covering         in docs/architecture/          dependency ordering,
  all systems               adr-*.md                       engine compatibility
                                                                      |
                                                                      v
                                                         /create-control-manifest
                                                                      |
                                                                      v
                                                         Flat programmer rules
                                                         docs/architecture/
                                                         control-manifest.md
        Also in this phase:
        -------------------
        /ux-design  -->  /ux-review
        Accessibility requirements doc
        Interaction pattern library
```

### Step 3.1: Master Architecture Document

```
/create-architecture
```

Creates the overarching architecture document in `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
covering system boundaries, data flow, and integration points.

### Step 3.2: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

For each significant technical decision:

```
/architecture-decision "State Machine vs Behavior Tree for NPC AI"
```

**What happens:** The skill guides you through creating an ADR with:
- Context and decision drivers
- All options with pros/cons and engine compatibility
- Chosen option with rationale
- Consequences (positive, negative, risks)
- Dependencies (Depends On, Enables, Blocks, Ordering Note)
- GDD Requirements Addressed (linked by TR-ID)

ADRs go through a lifecycle: Proposed > Accepted > Superseded/Deprecated.

**Minimum 3 Foundation-layer ADRs are required** before the gate check.

**Retrofitting existing ADRs:** If you already have ADRs from a brownfield
project:

```
/architecture-decision retrofit docs/architecture/adr-005.md
```

This detects which template sections are missing and adds only those, never
overwriting existing content.

### Step 3.3: Architecture Review

```
/architecture-review
```

Validates all ADRs together:
- Topological sort of ADR dependencies (detects cycles)
- Engine compatibility verification
- GDD Revision Flags (flags GDD sections that need updates based on ADR choices)
- TR-ID registry maintenance (`docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml`)

### Step 3.4: Control Manifest

```
/create-control-manifest
```

Takes all Accepted ADRs and produces a flat programmer rules sheet:

```
docs/architecture/control-manifest.md
```

This contains Required patterns, Forbidden patterns, and Guardrails organized
by code layer. Stories created later embed the manifest version date so
staleness can be detected.

### Step 3.5: Accessibility Requirements (moved to Phase 4)

`design/accessibility-requirements.md` commits to a tier (Basic / Standard /
Comprehensive / Exemplary) and fills the 4-axis feature matrix (visual, motor,
cognitive, auditory).

**It is authored in Phase 4 by `/ux-design`**, which initializes it alongside
`design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` on first run. Run `/ux-design` before the
key-screen specs so every spec is validated against a committed tier.

Earlier versions of this guide listed it as a Phase 3 prerequisite, but no
Phase 3 step produced it — the Phase 3 gate checked for a file nothing wrote.
The tier is still a design commitment rather than a screen deliverable; it is
simply the first thing `/ux-design` asks about.

### Phase 3 Gate

```
/gate-check pre-production
```

**Requirements to pass:**

- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` exists
- At least 3 ADRs exist and are Accepted
- Architecture review report exists
- `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md` exists
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/` and `.github/workflows/tests.yml` exist
  (run `/test-setup`)

---

## Phase 4: Pre-Production

### What Happens in This Phase

You create UX specs for key screens, prototype risky mechanics, turn design
documents into implementable stories, plan your first sprint, and build a
Vertical Slice that proves the core loop is fun.

### Phase 4 Pipeline

```
/ux-design  -->  /vertical-slice  -->  /create-epics  -->  /create-stories  -->  /sprint-plan
    |                   |                   |                   |                       |

                                                          routes to right agent)
```

### Step 4.1: UX Specs for Key Screens

Before writing epics, create UX specs so that story authors know what screens
exist and what player interactions they must support.

**UX Specs:**

```
/ux-design main-menu
/ux-design core-gameplay-hud
```

Three modes: screen/flow, HUD, and interaction patterns. Output goes to
`design/ux/`. Each spec includes: player need, layout zones, states,
interaction map, data requirements, events fired, accessibility, localization.

On first run it initializes `design/accessibility-requirements.md` and
`design/ux/interaction-patterns.md`; every later run reads the committed tier
from that file plus your input method config from `technical-preferences.md`
to drive accessibility and input coverage checks — no need to re-specify them
per screen.

> **Tip:** `/design-system` emits a 📌 UX Flag for every system with UI
> requirements. Use those flags as a checklist for which screens need specs.

**Interaction Pattern Library:**

```
/ux-design interaction-patterns
```

Create `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` — 16 standard controls plus
game-specific patterns (inventory slot, ability icon, HUD bar, dialogue box,
etc.) with animation and sound standards.

**UX Review:**

```
/ux-review all
```

Validates UX specs for GDD alignment and accessibility tier compliance.
Produces APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION / MAJOR REVISION NEEDED verdict.

### Step 4.2: Build the Vertical Slice

The vertical slice is the production-quality proof that you can build the full
game loop end-to-end before committing to full Production.

```
/vertical-slice
```

**What it proves:** Does a player, starting from nothing, experience the core
fantasy within a few minutes, without developer guidance?

**What it builds:** A near-production-quality playable build covering at least
one complete [start → challenge → resolution] cycle. Uses real architecture
layers, real naming conventions, no hardcoded values — but not final art or
audio. This is not a throwaway like the concept prototype; it demonstrates
production pipeline feasibility.

**Note on concept prototyping:** If you ran `/prototype` in Phase 1 (Concept),
you already validated the core idea is fun. The vertical slice now validates
you can build it properly. They answer different questions. If you skipped the
concept prototype, now is a reasonable time to run one first before investing
in the full slice.

**Verdict:** The vertical slice produces a PROCEED / PIVOT / KILL verdict.
- **PROCEED** → move to Step 4.3 (epics and stories)
- **PIVOT** → revise affected GDDs with `/design-system [mechanic]`, then re-run `/vertical-slice`
- **KILL** → return to `/brainstorm` with what you learned

### Step 4.3: Create Epics and Stories From Design Artifacts

```
/create-epics layer: foundation
/create-stories [epic-slug]   # repeat for each epic
/create-epics layer: core
/create-stories [epic-slug]   # repeat for each core epic
```

`/create-epics` reads your GDDs, ADRs, and architecture to define epic scope —
one epic per architectural module. Then `/create-stories` breaks each epic into
implementable story files in `production/epics/[slug]/`. Each story embeds:
- GDD requirement references (TR-IDs, not quoted text -- stays fresh)
- ADR references (only from Accepted ADRs; Proposed ADRs cause `Status: Blocked`)
- Control manifest version date (for staleness detection)
- Engine-specific implementation notes
- Acceptance criteria from the GDD

Once stories exist, run `/dev-story [story-path]` to implement one — it routes
automatically to the correct programmer agent.

### Step 4.4: Validate Stories Before Pickup

```
/story-readiness production/epics/combat/story-combat-damage-calc.md
```

Checks: Design completeness, Architecture coverage, Scope clarity, Definition
of Done. Verdict: READY / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED.

### Step 4.5: Effort Estimation

```
/estimate production/epics/combat/story-combat-damage-calc.md
```

Provides effort estimates with risk assessment.

### Step 4.6: Plan Your First Sprint

```
/sprint-plan new
```

**What happens:** The `producer` agent collaborates on sprint planning:
- Asks for sprint goal and available time
- Breaks the goal into Must Have / Should Have / Nice to Have tasks
- Identifies risks and blockers
- Creates `production/sprints/sprint-01.md`
- Populates `production/sprint-status.yaml` (machine-readable story tracking)

### Step 4.7: Vertical Slice (Strongly Recommended)

Before advancing to Production, build and playtest a Vertical Slice:

- One complete end-to-end core loop, playable from start to finish
- Representative quality (not placeholder everything)
- Played unguided in at least 1 documented session (3 is better)
- Playtest report written (`/playtest-report`)

**Skipping is allowed; shipping a broken one is not.** `/gate-check production`
applies an asymmetric rule:

- **Slice not built** → CONCERNS, never FAIL. Skipping is a valid solo-dev or
  time-boxed call. The gate surfaces the risk (late-stage design pivots) and
  you decide.
- **Slice built but a validation item fails** (nobody played it unguided, the
  core loop does not complete, a fun-blocker bug exists) → FAIL. A broken slice
  is worse evidence than no slice.

### Phase 4 Gate

```
/gate-check production
```

**Requirements to pass:**

- At least 1 UX spec reviewed in `design/ux/`
- UX review completed (APPROVED or NEEDS REVISION with documented risks)
- At least 1 prototype with README
- Story files exist in `production/epics/[epic-slug]/`
- At least 1 sprint plan exists
- At least 1 playtest report exists (Vertical Slice played in 3+ sessions)

---

## Phase 5: Production

### What Happens in This Phase

This is the core production loop. You work in sprints (typically 1-2 weeks),
implementing features story by story, tracking progress, and closing stories
through a structured completion review. This phase repeats until your game
is content-complete.

### Phase 5 Pipeline (Per Sprint)

```
/sprint-plan new  -->  /story-readiness  -->  implement  -->  /story-done
       |                     |                    |                |
       v                     v                    v                v
  Sprint created       Story validated      Code written     8-phase review:
  sprint-status.yaml   READY verdict        Tests pass       verify criteria,
  populated                                                  check deviations,
                                                             update story status
       |
       |  (repeat per story until sprint complete)
       v
  /sprint-status  (quick 30-line snapshot anytime)
  /scope-check    (if scope is growing)
  /retrospective  (at sprint end)
```

### Step 5.1: The Story Lifecycle

The production phase centers on the **story lifecycle**:

```
/story-readiness  -->  implement  -->  /story-done  -->  next story
```

**1. Story Readiness:** Before picking up a story, validate it:

```
/story-readiness production/epics/combat/story-combat-damage-calc.md
```

This checks design completeness, architecture coverage, ADR status (blocks
if ADR is still Proposed), control manifest version (warns if stale), and
scope clarity. Verdict: READY / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED.

**2. Implementation:** Work with the appropriate agents:

- `gameplay-programmer` for gameplay systems
- `engine-programmer` for core engine work
- `ai-programmer` for AI behavior
- `network-programmer` for multiplayer
- `ui-programmer` for UI code
- `tools-programmer` for dev tools

All agents follow the collaborative protocol: they read the design doc, ask
clarifying questions, present architectural options, get your approval, then
implement.

**3. Story Completion:** When a story is done:

```
/story-done production/epics/combat/story-combat-damage-calc.md
```

This runs an 8-phase completion review:
1. Find and read the story file
2. Load referenced GDD, ADRs, and control manifest
3. Verify acceptance criteria (auto-checkable, manual, deferred)
4. Check for GDD/ADR deviations (BLOCKING / ADVISORY / OUT OF SCOPE)
5. Prompt for code review
6. Generate completion report (COMPLETE / COMPLETE WITH NOTES / BLOCKED)
7. Update story `Status: Complete` with completion notes
8. Surface the next ready story

Tech debt discovered during review is logged to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`.

### Step 5.2: Sprint Tracking

Check progress anytime:

```
/sprint-status
```

Quick 30-line snapshot reading from `production/sprint-status.yaml`.

If scope is growing:

```
/scope-check production/sprints/sprint-03.md
```

This compares current scope against the original plan and flags scope increase,
recommends cuts.

### Step 5.3: Content Tracking

```
/content-audit
```

Compares GDD-specified content against what has been implemented. Catches
content gaps early.

### Step 5.4: Design Change Propagation

When a GDD changes after stories have been created:

```
/propagate-design-change design/gdd/combat-system.md
```

Git-diffs the GDD, finds affected ADRs, generates an impact report, and
walks you through Superseded/update/keep decisions.

### Step 5.5: Multi-System Features (Team Orchestration)

For features spanning multiple domains, use team skills:

```
/team-combat "healing ability with HoT and cleanse"
/team-narrative "Act 2 story content"
/team-ui "inventory screen redesign"
/team-level "forest dungeon level"
/team-audio "combat audio pass"
```

Each team skill coordinates a 6-phase collaborative workflow:
1. **Design** -- game-designer asks questions, presents options
2. **Architecture** -- lead-programmer proposes code structure
3. **Parallel Implementation** -- specialists work simultaneously
4. **Integration** -- gameplay-programmer wires everything together
5. **Validation** -- qa-tester runs against acceptance criteria
6. **Report** -- coordinator summarizes status

The orchestration is automated, but **decision points stay with you**.

### Step 5.6: Sprint Review and Next Sprint

At the end of a sprint:

```
/retrospective
```

Analyzes planned vs. completed, velocity, blockers, and actionable improvements.

Then plan the next sprint:

```
/sprint-plan new
```

### Step 5.7: Milestone Reviews

At milestone checkpoints:

```
/milestone-review "alpha"
```

Produces feature completeness, quality metrics, risk assessment, and go/no-go
recommendation.

### Phase 5 Gate

```
/gate-check polish
```

**Requirements to pass:**

- All MVP stories complete
- Playtesting: 3 sessions covering new player, mid-game, and difficulty curve
- Fun hypothesis validated
- No confusion loops in playtest data

---

## Phase 6: Polish

### What Happens in This Phase

Your game is feature-complete. Now you make it good. This phase focuses on
performance, balance, accessibility, audio, visual polish, and playtesting.

### Phase 6 Pipeline

```
/perf-profile  -->  /balance-check  -->  /asset-audit  -->  /playtest-report (x3)
       |                  |                    |                    |
       v                  v                    v                    v
  Profile CPU/GPU    Analyze formulas     Verify naming,      Cover: new player,
  memory, optimize   and data for         formats, sizes      mid-game, difficulty
  bottlenecks        broken progressions                      curve

  /tech-debt  -->  /team-polish
       |                |
       v                v
  Track and        Coordinated pass:
  prioritize       performance + art +
  debt items       audio + UX + QA
```

### Step 6.1: Performance Profiling

```
/perf-profile
```

Guides you through structured performance profiling:
- Establish targets (FPS, memory, platform)
- Identify bottlenecks ranked by impact
- Generate actionable optimization tasks with code locations and expected gains

### Step 6.2: Balance Analysis

```
/balance-check assets/data/combat_damage.json
```

Analyzes balance data for statistical outliers, broken progression curves,
degenerate strategies, and economy imbalances.

### Step 6.3: Asset Audit

```
/asset-audit
```

Verifies naming conventions, file format standards, and size budgets across
all assets.

### Step 6.4: Playtesting (Required: 3 Sessions)

```
/playtest-report
```

Generates structured playtest reports. Three sessions are required, covering:
- New player experience
- Mid-game systems
- Difficulty curve

### Step 6.5: Technical Debt Assessment

```
/tech-debt
```

Scans for TODO/FIXME/HACK comments, code duplication, overly complex functions,
missing tests, and outdated dependencies. Each item categorized and prioritized.

### Step 6.6: Coordinated Polish Pass

```
/team-polish "combat system"
```

Coordinates 4 specialists in parallel:
1. Performance optimization (performance-analyst)
2. Visual polish (technical-artist)
3. Audio polish (sound-designer)
4. Feel/juice (gameplay-programmer + technical-artist)

You set priorities; the team executes with your approval at each step.

### Step 6.7: Localization and Accessibility

```
/localize src/
```

Scans for hardcoded strings, concatenation that breaks translation, text that
does not account for expansion, and missing locale files.

Accessibility is audited against the tier committed in Phase 3's accessibility
requirements document.

### Phase 6 Gate

```
/gate-check release
```

**Requirements to pass:**

- At least 3 playtest reports exist
- Coordinated polish pass completed (`/team-polish`)
- No blocking performance issues
- Accessibility tier requirements met

---

## Phase 7: Release

### What Happens in This Phase

Your game is polished, tested, and ready. Now you ship it.

### Phase 7 Pipeline

```
/release-checklist  -->  /launch-checklist  -->  /team-release
        |                       |                      |
        v                       v                      v
  Pre-release             Full cross-department    Coordinate:
  validation across       validation (Go/No-Go     build, QA sign-off,
  code, content,          per department)           deployment, launch
  store, legal
                    Also: /changelog, /patch-notes, /hotfix
```

### Step 7.1: Release Checklist

```
/release-checklist v1.0.0
```

Generates a comprehensive pre-release checklist covering:
- Build verification (all platforms compile and run)
- Certification requirements (platform-specific)
- Store metadata (descriptions, screenshots, trailers)
- Legal compliance (EULA, privacy policy, ratings)
- Save game compatibility
- Analytics verification

### Step 7.2: Launch Readiness (Full Validation)

```
/launch-checklist
```

Complete cross-department validation:

| Department | What Is Checked |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Engineering** | Build stability, crash rates, memory leaks, load times |
| **Design** | Feature completeness, tutorial flow, difficulty curve |
| **Art** | Asset quality, missing textures, LOD levels |
| **Audio** | Missing sounds, mixing levels, spatial audio |
| **QA** | Open bug count by severity, regression suite pass rate |
| **Narrative** | Dialogue completeness, lore consistency, typos |
| **Localization** | All strings translated, no truncation, locale testing |
| **Accessibility** | Compliance checklist, assistive feature testing |
| **Store** | Metadata complete, screenshots approved, pricing set |
| **Marketing** | Press kit ready, launch trailer, social media scheduled |
| **Community** | Patch notes draft, FAQ prepared, support channels ready |
| **Infrastructure** | Servers scaled, CDN configured, monitoring active |
| **Legal** | EULA finalized, privacy policy, COPPA/GDPR compliance |

Each item gets a **Go / No-Go** status. All must be Go to ship.

### Step 7.3: Generate Player-Facing Content

```
/patch-notes v1.0.0
```

Generates player-friendly patch notes from git history and sprint data.
Translates developer language into player language.

```
/changelog v1.0.0
```

Generates an internal changelog (more technical, for the team).

### Step 7.4: Coordinate the Release

```
/team-release
```

Coordinates release-manager, QA, and DevOps through:
1. Pre-release validation
2. Build management
3. Final QA sign-off
4. Deployment preparation
5. Go/No-Go decision

### Step 7.5: Ship

The `validate-push` hook will warn you when pushing to `main` or `develop`.
This is intentional -- release pushes should be deliberate:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```

### Step 7.6: Post-Launch

**Hotfix workflow** for critical production bugs:

```
/hotfix "Players losing save data when inventory exceeds 99 items"
```

Bypasses normal sprint processes with a full audit trail:
1. Creates a hotfix branch
2. Implements the fix
3. Ensures backport to development branch
4. Documents the incident

**Post-mortem** after launch stabilizes:

```
Ask Claude to create a post-mortem using the template at
.claude/docs/templates/post-mortem.md
```

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These topics apply across all phases.

### Project Scale

Scale decides **which steps exist**. It is the single biggest lever on how long the
workflow is. Set once during `/start`, saved to `production/scale.txt`.

| Scale | What it is | Required steps before your first line of code |
|---|---|---|
| `jam` | Jam or spike, under about a week | **3** — `/brainstorm`, `/setup-engine`, `/prototype` |
| `indie` | **Default.** Solo dev or small team shipping a real game | **~12** |
| `studio` | Team with handoffs between people who weren't in the room | **~13 unique** (~26 invocations on a 6-system game) |

What each scale drops:

| | jam | indie | studio |
|---|---|---|---|
| System GDDs (`/design-system`) | none — `/quick-design` as needed | MVP-tier systems | all systems |
| Architecture | none | `architecture.md` + review | + 3 Foundation ADRs |
| UX specs | none | core HUD | main menu + HUD + pause |
| Epics and stories | none | yes | yes |
| Art bible | optional | optional until asset production | all 9 sections |
| Phase gates | 0 | 2 | 6 |

**Scale is a floor, not a ceiling.** Every skill remains available at every scale —
marking a step optional at `jam` means "not required", never "not allowed". Run
`/design-system` during a jam if a mechanic genuinely warrants it.

**Choose by who has to read the output, not by ambition.** A design document exists
so someone who was not in the room can act on it. A solo dev re-reading their own
notes needs far less than a team briefing an outsourcer. Picking `indie` for a game
you hope becomes big is correct — move to `studio` the day a second person joins.

Change it any time by editing `production/scale.txt`. Raising the scale mid-project
does not invalidate anything; `/help` simply starts listing the additional steps as
required, and `/gate-check` starts expecting the additional gates.

### Scale vs. review mode

These two settings are **independent and compose**:

- **Scale** (`production/scale.txt`) → *which steps exist*
- **Review mode** (`production/review-mode.txt`) → *who reviews them*

`studio` scale with `solo` review means every artifact gets written but no director
agent reviews any of it. `jam` scale with `full` review means very few artifacts, each
one heavily scrutinised. Both are valid. Set them independently.

### Director Review Modes

Director gates are specialist agents that review your work at key workflow steps.
By default they run at every checkpoint. You can control how much review you get.

**Set your review intensity once during `/start`.** Saved to `production/review-mode.txt`.

| Mode | What runs | Best for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `full` | All director gates at every step | New projects, learning the system |
| `lean` | Directors only at phase transitions (`/gate-check`) | Experienced devs |
| `solo` | No director reviews | Game jams, prototypes, maximum speed |

**Override for a single run** without changing your global setting:

```
/brainstorm space horror --review full
/architecture-decision --review solo
```

The `--review` flag works on all gate-using skills. Change the global mode at any
time by editing `production/review-mode.txt` directly or re-running `/start`.

Full gate definitions and check pattern: `.claude/docs/director-gates.md`

---

### The Collaboration Protocol

This system is **user-driven collaborative**, not autonomous.

**Pattern:** Question > Options > Decision > Draft > Approval

Every agent interaction follows this pattern:
1. Agent asks clarifying questions
2. Agent presents 2-4 options with trade-offs and reasoning
3. You decide
4. Agent drafts based on your decision
5. You review and refine
6. Agent asks "May I write this to [filepath]?" before writing

See `docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md` for the full protocol with
examples.

### The AskUserQuestion Tool

Agents use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for structured option presentation.
The pattern is Explain then Capture: full analysis in conversation text first,
then a clean UI picker for the decision. Use it for design choices,
architecture decisions, and strategic questions. Do not use it for open-ended
discovery questions or simple yes/no confirmations.

### Agent Coordination (3-Tier Hierarchy)

```
Tier 1 (Directors):    creative-director, technical-director, producer
                                          |
Tier 2 (Leads):        game-designer, lead-programmer, art-director,
                       audio-director, narrative-director, qa-lead,
                       release-manager, localization-lead
                                          |
Tier 3 (Specialists):  gameplay-programmer, engine-programmer,
                       ai-programmer, network-programmer, ui-programmer,
                       tools-programmer, systems-designer, level-designer,
                       economy-designer, world-builder, writer,
                       technical-artist, sound-designer, ux-designer,
                       qa-tester, performance-analyst, devops-engineer,
                       analytics-engineer, accessibility-specialist,
                       live-ops-designer, prototyper, security-engineer,
                       community-manager, godot-specialist,
                       godot-gdscript-specialist, godot-shader-specialist,
                       godot-csharp-specialist, godot-gdextension-specialist,
                       unity-specialist, unity-dots-specialist,
                       unity-shader-specialist, unity-addressables-specialist,
                       unity-ui-specialist, unreal-specialist,
                       ue-blueprint-specialist, ue-gas-specialist,
                       ue-replication-specialist, ue-umg-specialist
```

**Coordination rules:**
- Vertical delegation: Directors > Leads > Specialists. Never skip tiers for
  complex decisions.
- Horizontal consultation: Agents at the same tier may consult each other but
  must not make binding decisions outside their domain.
- Conflict resolution: Design conflicts go to `creative-director`. Technical
  conflicts go to `technical-director`. Scope conflicts go to `producer`.
- No unilateral cross-domain changes.

### Automated Hooks (Safety Net)

The system has 12 hooks that run automatically:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `session-start.sh` | Session start | Shows branch, recent commits, detects active.md for recovery |
| `detect-gaps.sh` | Session start | Detects fresh projects (no engine, no concept) and suggests `/start` |
| `pre-compact.sh` | Before compaction | Dumps session state into conversation for auto-recovery |
| `post-compact.sh` | After compaction | Reminds Claude to restore session state from `active.md` |
| `notify.sh` | Notification event | Shows Windows toast notification via PowerShell |
| `validate-commit.sh` | Before commit | Checks for design doc references, valid JSON, no hardcoded values |
| `validate-push.sh` | Before push | Warns on pushes to main/develop |
| `validate-assets.sh` | Before commit | Checks asset naming and size |
| `validate-skill-change.sh` | Skill file written | Advises running `/skill-test` after `.claude/skills/` changes |
| `log-agent.sh` | Agent start | Logs agent invocations for audit trail |
| `log-agent-stop.sh` | Agent stop | Completes agent audit trail (start + stop) |
| `session-stop.sh` | Session end | Final session logging |

### Context Resilience

**Session state file:** `production/session-state/active.md` is a living
checkpoint. Update it after each significant milestone. After any disruption
(compaction, crash, `/clear`), read this file first.

**Incremental writing:** When creating multi-section documents, write each
section to file immediately after approval. This means completed sections
survive crashes and context compactions. Previous discussion about written
sections can be safely compacted.

**Automatic recovery:** The `session-start.sh` hook detects and previews
`active.md` automatically. The `pre-compact.sh` hook dumps state into the
conversation before compaction.

**Sprint status tracking:** `production/sprint-status.yaml` is the
machine-readable story tracker. Written by `/sprint-plan` (init) and
`/story-done` (status updates). Read by `/sprint-status`, `/help`, and
`/story-done` (next story). Eliminates fragile markdown scanning.

### Brownfield Adoption

For existing projects that already have some artifacts:

```
/adopt
```

Or targeted:

```
/adopt gdds
/adopt adrs
/adopt stories
/adopt infra
```

This audits existing artifacts for **format** (not existence), classifies gaps
as BLOCKING/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW, builds an ordered migration plan, and writes
`docs/adoption-plan-[date].md`. Core principle: MIGRATION not REPLACEMENT --
it never regenerates existing work, only fills gaps.

Individual skills also support retrofit mode:

```
/design-system retrofit design/gdd/combat-system.md
/architecture-decision retrofit docs/architecture/adr-005.md
```

These detect which sections are present vs. missing and fill only the gaps.

### Gate System

Phase gates are formal checkpoints. **The argument is the phase you are entering,
not the one you are leaving** — `concept` is therefore not a valid value, since no
gate leads into Concept:

```
/gate-check systems-design       # Concept -> Systems Design
/gate-check technical-setup      # Systems Design -> Technical Setup
/gate-check pre-production       # Technical Setup -> Pre-Production
/gate-check production           # Pre-Production -> Production
/gate-check polish               # Production -> Polish
/gate-check release              # Polish -> Release
```

Run `/gate-check` with no argument to have it detect your current stage and
confirm the transition before running.

**Verdicts:**
- **PASS** -- all requirements met, advance to next phase
- **CONCERNS** -- requirements met with acknowledged risks, passable
- **FAIL** -- requirements not met; the verdict is **advisory**, not a hard block.
  It reports what is missing and why advancing is risky; the user always decides
  whether to proceed. See "Gate verdicts are advisory" below.

When a gate passes, `production/stage.txt` is updated (only then), which
controls the status line and `/help` behavior.

#### Gate verdicts are advisory

A FAIL does not lock anything. `/gate-check` has no mechanism to prevent you from
running the next phase's skills, and it is not supposed to — you own the project,
the gate is a second opinion. What FAIL actually does:

- lists the specific missing artifacts and failed quality checks
- explains what each one protects against
- declines to advance `production/stage.txt` on its own

You can proceed anyway; ask it to advance the stage explicitly and it will, with
the accepted risks recorded. This matches `.claude/docs/workflow-catalog.yaml`
(lines 14-15) and `/gate-check` itself, which both state verdicts never hard-block.

The one place this is asymmetric is the Vertical Slice — see Step 4.7. Not building
one is CONCERNS; building a broken one is FAIL. The rule targets bad evidence, not
missing evidence.

### Reverse Documentation

For code that exists without design docs (common after brownfield adoption):

```
/reverse-document src/gameplay/combat/
```

Reads existing code and generates GDD-format design documentation from it.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of the System

1. **Always start with design, then implement.** The agent system is built
   around the assumption that a design document exists before code is written.
   Agents reference GDDs constantly.

2. **Use team skills for cross-cutting features.** Do not try to manually
   coordinate 4 agents yourself -- let `/team-combat`, `/team-narrative`,
   etc. handle the orchestration.

3. **Trust the rules system.** When a rule flags something in your code, fix
   it. The rules encode hard-won game development wisdom (data-driven values,
   delta time, accessibility, etc.).

4. **Compact proactively.** At ~65-70% context usage, compact or `/clear`.
   The pre-compact hook saves your progress. Do not wait until you are at the
   limit.

5. **Use the right tier of agent.** Do not ask `creative-director` to write a
   shader. Do not ask `qa-tester` to make design decisions. The hierarchy
   exists for a reason.

6. **Run /help when uncertain.** It reads your actual project state and tells
   you the single most important next step.

7. **Run `/design-review` before handing designs to programmers.** This
   catches incomplete specs early, saving rework.

8. **Run `/code-review` after every major feature.** Catch architectural
   issues before they propagate.

9. **Prototype risky mechanics first.** A day of prototyping can save a week
   of production on a mechanic that does not work.

10. **Keep your sprint plans honest.** Use `/scope-check` regularly. Scope
    creep is the number one killer of indie games.

11. **Document decisions with ADRs.** Future-you will thank present-you for
    recording *why* things were built the way they were.

12. **Use the story lifecycle religiously.** `/story-readiness` before pickup,
    `/story-done` after completion. This catches deviations early and keeps
    the pipeline honest.

13. **Write to files early and often.** Incremental section writing means your
    design decisions survive crashes and compactions. The file is the memory,
    not the conversation.
